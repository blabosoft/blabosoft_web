Hi, I am **Ákos Pintér** and I am a freelancer software engineer with more than 10 years experience. I live in Budapest, Hungary with my small family.

I work with various technologies on the full stack. Just some examples: backend (`.NET Core`, `Python`), frontend (`React` + `Typescript`), Kubernetes (`k3s`), cloud (`AWS`, `DigitalOcean`), data (`Postgres`, `SQL Server`, `S3`, `DynamoDB`), auth (`OpenIdConnect`).

My primary focus is on building highly available and efficient systems hosted on Kubernetes or on a serverless option in the cloud.

What is BlaboSoft? It is a brandname which is intended to cover my professional work. I write blog posts here that are related to my work and interest. I planned that for a long time, so I am excited about it :)

I proudly work together with clients from the United Kingdom like [UK Fuels](https://ukfuels.co.uk "UK Fuels Website"){:target="_blank"} and [iCompario](https://icompario.com "iCompario Website"){:target="_blank"}.
